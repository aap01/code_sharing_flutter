# Code Sharing Flutter

This is an open source project that aims towards solving challenges, that arise from developing and maintaining multiple projects of similar domain; through discussion and concrete examples. These examples will contain `flutter` and `dart` code.

## What challenges are we talking about?
 - Identify common features among several projects
 - Develop these features in a plug and play fashion while keeping them highly extensible
 - Maintain common dependencies as well as project specific dependencies
 - Establish a connection between the common features and project specific features at minimum effort
 - Search and find the already developed common features at minimum effort
